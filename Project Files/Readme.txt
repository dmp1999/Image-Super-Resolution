Project Description:

DIFFERENT APPROACHES TOWARDS IMAGE SUPER RESOLUTION

The project aims to get an understanding of the work that has been done in the field of Image Super Resolution so far and explore
different approaches to image super resolution. Starting with the readings of traditional methods of upsampling used in Digital Image
Processing, this project aims to explore in deep the workings of various deep networks that have been introduced so far in the
area of Image Super Resolution and reimplement the state-of-the-art architectures to get custom results. The final aim of the project
is to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the CNNs and their workings in context of converting a low resolution image to a 
high resolution image.

The scope was to include GANs in the project as well which perform iterative image refinement but it wasn't possible given the 
limited time frame of the project and has been incorporated in the future works.
